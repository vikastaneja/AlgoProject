     The string will contain only ascii characters. If there is a tie in the maximum number
     of times a character appears in the string, print the character which appears first in the string.

     Notes:
     1. The length of the string will be between 1 and 10000, inclusive.
     2. Make sure you don't print anything other than a single character in the function. Otherwise, your solution will be marked wrong.
     3. You only need to complete the function printMaximumOccurringCharacter.
